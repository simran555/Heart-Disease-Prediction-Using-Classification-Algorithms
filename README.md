Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction using various classification algorithms
overview of use/purpose: Cardiovascular diseases remain a significant global health concern, necessitating accurate and efficient methods for early detection and diagnosis. ​
Aim of this project is to design a robust predictive model for heart disease by employing various classification algorithms.​

Description
To predict if a person has heart disease using different types of classification 
algorithm. This project includes the use of logistic regression, K means, Naive Bayes, SVM 
and KNN algorithm. Classification algorithms are used to predict categorical data 
from a given test dataset. First of all, these algorithms are implemented
separately and then I have used heart_dataset to train those algorithms. I then used
our test dataset to test these algorithms (KNN, K-mean,Naive bayes SVM and 
logistic regression) and find the accuracy and efficiency of each algorithm 
and compare them. Then, analyzed the best suited algorithm for this purpose.

How to run the program
1. Download the heart_dataset
2. Download python file named Data preprocessing, implementation
3. Change the location of dataset according to your location and run all the fields
4. If you want to understand each algorithms sepearately, download sepearate files of KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM.
